# Welcome!

This is my personal website. It is built with Astro and hosted on Netlify. I'm using Tailwind for styling and some React for interactive components.

It is necessary to use React/Tailwind/Astro/Shadcn for this? No, but I wanted to.

The idea is to have my CV in a digital format and try to start writing some things, mostly guides on web dev. I like to try new technologies and learn and experiment with stuff, so I think it would be good to have some documentation for my future self and maybe help others too.

Feel free to explore the code and reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!

Cheers, Tomi.
